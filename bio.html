			Originally from Tampa Bay, FL, Ross spent eight years in the Army, graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point. After struggling to change the massive bureaucracy that is the Armed Forces, he set his sights on joining a more nimble industry. Immediately after leaving the service in Texas Ross joined a firm providing software and services to the telecom industry and realized he had found his niche. Following a geographic move back to the East Coast to support his spouse Ross set his sights on becoming an impactful change agent, which led him to attend Darden.</p>
